## 👨‍💻 About Me

> **Hello! I'm a passionate full-stack developer who loves building exceptional digital experiences.**  
> My journey in web development started with curiosity about how websites work, and has evolved into a career creating scalable, user-friendly applications.

I specialize in:
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, responsive & accessible UIs
- **Backend**: Django, RESTful APIs, PostgreSQL
- **Mobile**: Flutter, React Native
- **Design**: Figma, UI/UX best practices

When I'm not coding, I explore new tech, contribute to open-source, or design in Figma.
